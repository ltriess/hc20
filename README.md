This repo holds the [Google Hash Code 2020](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode) solutions of our team.
Take a look at the [problem description](problem_statement.pdf).

## Tips for next year
- use randomness in solutions to get multiple different scores

    pros:
    - sample from a distribution multiple points to get better max
    - get a feeling for dataset dependent standard deviations on score to estimate where the greatest gains are possible
